# Decomposing-the-Toffoli-Gate

There are two ways in which I have decomposed the Toffoli Gate in this repository:-


1) One Qubit and 6 CNOT gates (This is implemented from the research paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.2316v1)

2) Using RZ SX CX gates only (Taken from the IBM Quantum Challenge 2021)
